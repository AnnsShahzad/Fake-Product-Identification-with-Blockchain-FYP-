# Fake-Product-Identification-with-Blockchain-FYP-
In this project, with emerging trends in mobile and wireless technology, Quick Response (QR) codes provide a robust technique to fight the practice of counterfeiting the products. Counterfeit products are detected using a QR code scanner, where a QR code of the product is linked to a Blockchain. So this system may be used to store product details and generated unique code of that product as blocks in the database. It collects the unique code from the user and compares the code against entries in the Blockchain database. If the code matches, it will give a notification to the customer, otherwise it will give the notification to the customer that the product is fake.
